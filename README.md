# crANNy
crANNy is an experimental framework for artificial neural networks (ANN). It allows you to define and train deep neural networks and features components for tensor calculus, gradient descent, backpropagation, and more. The project served as a foundation for personal research in the field of deep learning. The code is not optimized for performance. Comments, frontend components, and tests have been removed for now. The last update to the codebase was in 2017.
